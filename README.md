# Pixel Sand Cascade Simulator

## About
FallingSandSimulatorJS is a captivating and interactive particle simulation project built using p5.js. It simulates the dynamics of falling sand, allowing users to create and observe mesmerizing patterns of sand particles with varying hues. This simulation is not only a demonstration of the beauty of complexity emerging from simple rules but also serves as an educational tool for understanding basic physics concepts such as gravity and particle movement.

## Features
- **Interactive Sand Creation:** Click and drag your mouse across the canvas to create sand particles in real-time.
- **Colorful Particles:** Watch as the hues of sand particles change dynamically, creating a visually stunning effect.
- **Physics Simulation:** The simulation includes a simple physics engine that mimics gravity, allowing particles to fall and pile up naturally.
- **Customizable Parameters:** Easily adjust parameters such as particle size, gravity strength, and color change rate to experiment with different simulation behaviors.
